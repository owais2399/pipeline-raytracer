              The scene that you see in front of you tries to depict human existence. The spheres, while of different colors, all have the same inherent essense - they're all spheres. And not just that, they all exist in the same world where the same lights shine on all of them. Just as some humans are configured a bit differently, similarly the spheres all have unique positions in the world. And similar to how different people live differently blessed lives, the spheres also receive different proportions of the light. What is beautiful is how they share this light amongst themselves. Some spheres are reflective, they like to give off some of the light they receive to their neighboring spheres while others are a bit more selfish and like to keep as much light as they can.

              We built this scene using simple spheres and a plane to represent the ground.
              The spheres are all of the same radius but have different materials. The green and
              blue ones are glossy while the red and mustard ones are matte. The focal plane has been
              set so that only the blue sphere is in focus while everything else is out of focus. There
              are two point lights in the scene, one above each of the blue and red spheres. The soft shadows
              and reflections are the result of secondary rays that are projected for each hit of the primary
              ray. The shadows are also out of focus except for the shadow of the blue sphere.

              These images show some the same scene with and without scene lights.
              When the lights are turned off, the camera becomes the only source of light
              thereby elimintating any shadows in view. You can also see a version in which 
              we use a spotlight with a field of light of 30°. To turn off lighting, go to the 
              SimulationParameters.hpp file in the utilities folder and set lighting to false.

              The image shows the scene in which both matte and glossy materials have been
              used. The red and mustard spheres have matte shading while the green and
              blue spheres use glossy shading. The reflections happen because of secondary rays.
              You can see the difference secondary rays make in the on and off images. To turn off secondary rays, 
              go to the SimulationParameters.hpp file in the utilities folder and set secondary_rays to false.

            <p style="font-size: 1.4em">
              Rendering blur or depth of field is the most expensive operation as it requires
              firing 500 primary rays for each pixel of the viewplane. You can see the difference 
              turning blur on and off makes in the above images. The reason why the blur off image 
              has these black spots is due to lesser number of primary rays. Had we fired >1000 rays 
              for each pixel, these black dots won't appear since the raytracer would then have more data 
              of the scene. The reason why they disappear is that when blurring, each pixel in the final image 
              has a circle of confusion to which other light rays contribute and so the black spots gets filled.
              To turn off blur, go to the SimulationParameters.hpp file in the utilities folder and set blur to false.

              We implemented a SEADS acceleration structure which is more commonly known as the
              Grid Acceleration Structure. As per the data shown above, it is evident that the acceleration 
              structure took more time to render the scene than without it. The culprit for this is 
              our scene which is has far too few objects. What happens then is that the acceleration structure 
              takes more time to figure out which object to intersect the ray with than it would have to just 
              try them all.
